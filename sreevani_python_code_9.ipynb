        "The Brown Corpus is a collection of writing samples that was compiled in 1961 by professors at Brown University. The corpus contains approximately 500 writing samples totalling approximately 1,000,000 words. All of the writing samples are from 1961 and were written in American English. The samples cover a wide range of topics and come from a variety of sources, such as books, magazines, and newspapers. Although small by modern standards, the corpus was considered very large in its day. For many decades it was the primary dataset used in NLP research."
